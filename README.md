The “simple rules” are visualized using network graphs that characterize the relationships among the variables involved in the extracted rules. In these graphs, rules are depicted as circles connected by arrows to the associated variables, following a directional flow from the left-hand side (lhs) to the right-hand side (rhs). The circle size indicates the support: the greater the support, the larger the corresponding circle. The color represents the lift, with red indicating the highest values (Kirenz, 2020).
